# Integrated course program Object Oriented Programming

Build a Crypto-Trading Platform with C++. Develop Object Oriented programming and data handling skills in C++ through an exciting worked example

## About this Integrated Course Program

In this 5-course specialisation, you will develop various C++ programming skills. Rather than building many small programs as you will in other courses, we have taken a different approach: you will create a single, extensive program through the five courses. The program will be a simplified cryptocurrency exchange platform. We will cover the following learning objectives:

- Use control flow to build interactive, multi-branched, iterated programs

- Select appropriate data types to model the trading platform's information

- Convert algorithms from pseudo-code to C++ and test them

- Use classes to combine data and functions and to model interactions between different parts of a program

- Understand how to construct an extensive program from multiple modules

The content for this specialisation is taken from the University of London's online BSc Computer Science degree. If you complete the courses and eventually take the course 'Object Oriented Programming' in the degree, you progress should be carried across.

## Applied Learning Project

In this specialisation, you will build a single, large project: a cryptocurrency trading platform. You will build the program using C++ during five courses. The program runs in the command-line in text mode and it simulates the experience of buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The program works with a real data set representing the order book of a real currency exchange platform.

## Course 1: Use C++ to build a crypto trading platform I: user input

This course is the first of five courses aiming to help you to become confident working in the object-oriented paradigm in the C++ language. 

This specialisation is for individuals who want to learn about objected oriented programming. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of C++, all the way to building a crypto-currency exchange platform.

During the five courses, you will work with the instructor on a single project: a crypto-currency exchange platform. Whilst building the project, you will learn about a range of programming techniques from basic control flow and input/output through to file parsing, object-oriented techniques and user interaction on the console. 

In this first course, you will get started with C++ by writing, building and running your first program. You will then learn about text input/output, if statements and loops by building an interactive menu system for the crypto-currency exchange platform. Upon completing the course, you will be able to:

* Write, compile and run a C++ program that prints messages to the console
* Use the standard library to do text I/O in the console
* Write and call simple functions
* Use a while loop to repeatedly receive and respond to user input

**Learning Objective**

- By the end of the course, you will be able to write, compile and run a C++ program that takes user input and prints messages to the console.

- By the end of the course, you will be able to use loops and if statements to create an interactive menu system.

- By the end of the course, you will have started developing a simplified cryptocurrency trading platform.
